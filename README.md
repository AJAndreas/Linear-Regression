# Linear-Regression
Education Tutorials #1

This is a tutorial on linear regression using the diabetes toy dataset where we:
- Formulate the linear regression model mathematically and derive the closed form solution for the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter weights 
- Look at it's implementation using numpy and then comparing the predictions using the sklearn's linear regression
- Conduct statistical tests of significance to compute t-statistics and p-values to determine which features are statistically significant
- Finally, we investigate the performance of the linear regression model using the entire dataset vs. just the statistically significant features

This tutorial is part of a larger series planned for educational purposes only (my own and for the benefit of others) where I try to implement algorithms and models from scratch. 

I would welcome any corrections or comments from the community.
